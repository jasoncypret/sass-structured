# SASS Starter

This is a SASS boilerplate for starting new projects based on *[Scalable and Modular Architecture for CSS](https://smacss.com/)*, and *[Atomic Design](http://atomicdesign.bradfrost.com/)* methodologies.

### Methodoligies



#### Atoms (simular to [base](http://smacss.com/book/type-base) in SMACSS)

Resets, general styling, fonts


#### Organisms (simular to [layout](http://smacss.com/book/type-layout) in SMACSS)

Organisms are assemblies of molecules functioning together as a unit. Examples: pages, page structure, floats, positioning, and large grouping of molecules.


Modules = molecules









These methodoligies provide a structure for separting code and defining patterns within a system
